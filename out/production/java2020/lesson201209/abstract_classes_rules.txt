CLASSES
1. can't instantiate abstract class
2. may have abstract methods (0+)
3. private is allowed for nested classes (and makes no sense for outer level classes)
4. it doesn't make sense to declare abstract class final !!! (and is prohibited)
5. descendants of abstract must implement abstract methods from parents 
	OR be abstract themselves.

METHODS
1. abstract methods may be declared only inside abstract classes
2. no private and final keywords for abstract methods
3. may not have body (implementation)
